    <p>Shrimp scampi, it's the dish so nice, they named it twice. Well, sort of. The word "scampi" is Italian for the meaty tail portion of a prawn. Specifically, the large Dublin Bay prawn, a.k.a., lobsterette, or langoustine if you prefer. They're not exactly what we'd call shrimpy.</p>
    <p>Okay, so more than anything the term "shrimp scampi" is like saying "shrimp done in the style of prawns." In other words, with yummy garlic butter.</p>
